# Recommendations
After a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis, the top three cities recommended for opening new physical coffee shops are:

City 1: Ipoh
- **Highest Total Sales:** Ipoh leads with RM1,254,790 total sales, indicating a strong coffee culture and high demand.
- **High Average Sale per Person:** The average sale per person (RM24,130.58) is the highest among all cities, showing customers are willing to spend more.
- **Low Rent per Customer:** The average rent per customer (RM23.08) is the lowest among the top-performing cities, making it cost-effective to operate.

City 2: Johor bahru
- **High Total Sales:** Johor Bahru has the fourth-highest total sales (RM 827,230), reflecting a strong coffee market.
- **Large Customer Base:** With 69 total customers, it has one of the largest customer bases, ensuring steady foot traffic.
- **Reasonable Rent per Customer:** The average rent per customer (RM 26.09) is relatively low compared to cities like Kuala Lumpur and George Town.

City 3: Shah Alam
- **Strong Total Sales:** Shah Alam has the fifth-highest total sales (RM 745,980), indicating a healthy demand for coffee.
- **Growing Coffee Consumer Base:** With 162,500 estimated coffee consumers, there is significant potential for growth.
- **Moderate Rent per Customer:** The average rent per customer (RM 29.41) is reasonable compared to high-rent cities like Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya.

**Why not Kuala Lumpur?**
- While Kuala Lumpur has high sales and a large consumer base, the average rent per customer (RM 65.79) is the highest among all cities. This could erode profitability, especially for a new store. It’s better to focus on cities with a balance of strong sales, growth potential, and reasonable rent costs.

**Key Insights for Expansion**
- **Prioritize Cost Efficiency:** Cities like Ipoh and Johor Bahru offer low rent costs while maintaining strong sales performance.
- **Focus on Growth Potential:** Cities like Shah Alam and Johor Bahru have large or growing coffee consumer bases, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Avoid High-Rent Cities:** Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya have high rent costs, which may not be ideal for a new store unless you’re targeting a premium market.

**Final Recommendations**
- **Ipoh:** Best overall choice with high sales, high spending capacity, and low rent.
- **Johor Bahru:** Strong sales, large customer base, and reasonable rent.
- **Shah Alam:** Growing market, moderate rent, and solid sales performance.
